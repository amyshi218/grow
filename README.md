### Intro
I created a single page web app displaying Star Wars planets, planet residents and resident info. Upon entering the page, a series of get requests will be sent to the Star Wars Api and saved in state. Upon clicking on a planet, the page will render to show the residents on that planet. Clicking on resident name will render the page to show the residents information.
A search bar is present on the Planets page. After typing in 3 letters, the list will filter to show matching results.
Open localhost:3500 in your browser to see the web app.
